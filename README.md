_do things with running data_

## overview

 - process individual activity files in `.fit` format, provided in `Strava` data download.
 - process activities from the `Strava` API, downloaded through a simple `Flask` app that runs locally.  eventually, this will be the platform for displaying simple training statistics.
 - `notebooks` now contains a training block review notebook with some basic EDA, looking at total Training Impulse (TRIMP) for a given block, TRIMP per activity, and time in block spent in each heartrate zone.
